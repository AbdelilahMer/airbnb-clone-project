# airbnb-clone-project
The 
**AirBnB Clone Project**
 is a web application inspired by the popular vacation rental platform Airbnb.  
The goal of this project is to build a simplified version of the Airbnb service, allowing users to create, view, and manage property listings, book accommodations, and interact with hosts.  

This project is designed to help practice 
**full-stack web development**
, with a strong focus on backend logic, frontend integration, and database management.
## UI/UX Design Planning

### Color Styles
- **Primary Color (Green)**: #00A884 – Used for buttons, highlights, and call-to-action elements.  
- **Secondary Color (Turquoise/Blue-Green)**: #00BFA5 – Supporting elements such as icons and filters.  
- **Accent Color (Orange/Gold)**: #FF9800 – For prices, ratings, and key highlights.  
- **Background Color (White)**: #FFFFFF – Clean background for a minimal and modern look.  
- **Neutral Shades**:  
  - Light Gray: #F7F7F7 – Used for backgrounds and card containers.  
  - Medium Gray: #DDDDDD – For dividers, borders, and subtle UI details.  
  - Dark Gray: #333333 – For main text and headings.  

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Likely *Inter* or *Poppins* (commonly used in modern UI mockups).  
- **Font Weights**:  
  - Regular (400) — Body text and descriptions.  
  - Medium (500) — Emphasis on labels and subheadings.  
  - Semi-Bold (600) — Section titles.  
  - Bold (700) — Headings and important highlights.  

- **Font Sizes** (based on visual hierarchy):  
  - Heading 1 (H1): 32px — Hero section main title (“Find your favorite place here!”).  
  - Heading 2 (H2): 24px — Section titles (e.g., "Top-rated stays").  
  - Heading 3 (H3): 18px — Card titles (property names).  
  - Body Text: 14–16px — Descriptions, filters, and metadata.  
  - Captions/Labels: 12px — Prices, icons, and secondary information.  

### Why Identifying Design Properties Is Important
Identifying and documenting the design properties directly from the mockup ensures:  
1. **Consistency** – Every page and component follows the same visual rules.  
2. **Efficiency** – Developers can quickly apply predefined design tokens without guessing.  
3. **Scalability** – Easy to expand or modify styles when adding new features.  
4. **Accessibility** – Proper contrast, font sizes, and spacing improve readability for all users.  
5. **Collaboration** – Designers and developers share a common design language, reducing misunderstandings.
